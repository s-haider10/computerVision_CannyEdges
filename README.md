    - Utilized libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy for image processing tasks.
    - Explored image properties such as type, size, and value range.

2. **Image Loading and Cropping:**
    - Developed a function to load images and crop them based on specified bounding boxes.
    - Ensured compatibility with both grayscale and RGB images.

3. **Gaussian Convolution:**
    - Explored the effect of Gaussian blurring on images.
    - Investigated different interpolation methods and border conditions.

4. **Image Sharpening:**
    - Implemented a function to perform image sharpening using convolution with a specific kernel.
    - Visualized the sharpening effect on images.

5. **Gradient Computation:**
    - Developed a function to compute image gradients along the x-axis, y-axis, and their norm.
    - Visualized gradient images for different values of sigma.

6. **Canny Edges:**
    - Implemented the Canny edge detection algorithm, including non-maximum suppression and hysteresis thresholding.
    - Explored the effects of threshold values on edge detection.
    - Conducted parameter tuning to optimize edge detection results.
